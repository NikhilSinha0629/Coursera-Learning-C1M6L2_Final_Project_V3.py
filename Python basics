#Defining Functions

#Example: The function that shows total seconds when given the hours, minutes and seconds as input.


def print_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
    print(hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds)


print_seconds(1, 2, 3)

#Returing values example


#Use the get_seconds function to work out the amount of seconds in 2 hours and 30 minutes, then add this number to the amount of seconds in 45 minutes and 15 seconds. Then print the result.
def get_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
    return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds


amount_a = get_seconds(2, 30, 0)
amount_b = get_seconds(0, 45, 15)
result = ("The total number of seconds is:" + str(amount_a + amount_b))
print(result)

print(amount_a if amount_a >> amount_b else amount_b)
